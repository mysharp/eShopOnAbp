# eShopOnAbp

This project is a reference for who want to build microservice solutions with the ABP Framework.

> This project is in its infancy. By the time, we will write articles and documents to explain the goals and details of the project.

See [the announcement](https://blog.abp.io/abp/Introducing-the-eShopOnAbp-Project) post for more info.

## Issues

Please open issues on the main GitHub repository: https://github.com/abpframework/abp/issues

## How to Run?

You can either run in Visual Studio, or using [Microsoft Tye](https://github.com/dotnet/tye). Tye is a developer tool that makes developing, testing, and deploying micro-services and distributed applications easier.

 ### Requirements

- .NET 6.0+
- Docker
- Yarn

### Instructions

- Clone the repository ( [eShopOnAbp](https://github.com/abpframework/eShopOnAbp) )

- Install Tye (*follow [these steps](https://github.com/dotnet/tye/blob/main/docs/getting_started.md#installing-tye)*)

- Rename `.env.example` file to `.env` file and provide PayPal ClientID and Secret. If you want to bypass paypal sandbox implementation, uncomment [paypal bypass configuration](https://github.com/abpframework/eShopOnAbp/blob/main/services/payment/src/EShopOnAbp.PaymentService.HttpApi.Host/PaymentServiceHttpApiHostModule.cs#L36).

- Execute `run-tye.ps1`

- Wait until all applications are up!

  - You can check running application from tye dashboard ([localhost:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/))

- After all your backend services are up, start the angular application:

  ```bash
  cd apps/angular
  yarn start
  ```
